# Open Data Challenge

Open Data Culture is spreading, and every public entity is trying to publish their data in order to take part in the great Open Data party. 

## Is governments’ transparency improving?

Yes, it is. 

Opening and spreading data results in increased transparency, but what about participation, engagement and collaboration? Publishing Open Data is not enough to make it available: you have to allow people to deepen which questions they can answer by using your Open Data, and how they can integrate it with their own data.

### Let’s model Open Data together.

Which information joins different Open Data? Lots of countries around the world opened up to Open Data by following the US Data.gov example. How would it be to find relationship between all of these data for citizens and businesses, as well any other Open Data available? Join the Open Data Challenge and help us map any Open Data model.
